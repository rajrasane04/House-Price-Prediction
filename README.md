# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is a **data science-driven web application** designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other factors. The main objective is to build a tool that allows users to input relevant house details and receive an estimated market price based on historical data and machine learning models.

We are using the **MERN stack** for the frontend and backend integration, while the machine learning model is built using **Python** and served via an API. This project provides us with an opportunity to practice both web development and data science concepts, focusing on creating a full-stack application that is both functional and scalable.

## Key Features
- **User Input Form**: A simple and interactive form where users can input house details such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained model using historical housing data that predicts house prices based on the user input.
- **API Integration**: The frontend (MERN stack) sends user data to the backend API, which returns the predicted price from the machine learning model.
- **Data Visualizations**: Display trends and insights through charts and graphs for a better understanding of price patterns (planned future updates).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - **MongoDB**: Database for storing user queries and logs (optional).
  - **Express.js**: Backend framework for serving the frontend and handling API requests.
  - **React.js**: For building the user interface and handling user interactions.
  - **Node.js**: For running the server and handling backend logic.

- **Backend/API**:
  - **Flask/Django**: Python-based framework to handle API requests and process the machine learning model.
  - **scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy**: For data preprocessing and building the machine learning model.
  - **Model Deployment**: Trained model will be saved and deployed using tools like `joblib`.
